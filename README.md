This project is a simple and user-friendly To-Do List web application developed using core web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main goal of this application is to help users manage and keep track of their daily tasks efficiently. This app is designed with beginners in mind but still incorporates important development concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and persistent storage using the browser's local storage.

With this To-Do List, users can easily add, view, complete, and delete their tasks without needing to sign up or connect to the internet. All tasks are automatically saved in the browser's local storage, ensuring that the user's task list remains intact even after closing or refreshing the browser.

Key Features:

Add Tasks: Users can add tasks by clicking the "Add" button or by pressing the "Enter" key.

Task Completion: Tasks can be marked as completed by clicking on them.

Delete Tasks: Tasks can be removed individually by clicking the delete (×) icon.

Local Storage Support: All tasks are saved in the browser’s local storage, so data is not lost on reload.

Task Filtering: Tasks can be filtered as All, Active, or Completed to help users focus on what matters most.

Date-Based Task Handling:

Displays the current live time and date at the top.

Allows users to filter tasks based on a specific date.

Includes options to show previous and upcoming tasks separately.

Responsive UI: Clean and minimalistic design that works on both desktop and mobile devices.

Priority Selector (optional): Tasks can be assigned different priority levels (Low, Medium, High).

Real-Time Clock: The application displays the current date and time, which updates automatically.

Task Counter: Shows the number of total and completed tasks to help users measure their productivity.
